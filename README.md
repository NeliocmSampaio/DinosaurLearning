# DinosaurLearning
An application which allows Google Chrome's Dinosaur to learn how to survive without your help.

To run the program, use "python3 ai.py" with the terminal in the right side of the monitor and the chrome whindow in the left side. The dinosaur may be accessed typing chrome://dino in google chrome.

To run the Genetic algorithm, is necessary to ajust the capture region within the vision.py file. You may see what is the region for your computer capturing with a print and opening it in a image editor.

If you just want to see the results with a saved file, run the program with a name of the file with the model (python3 ai.py model.bcp).
